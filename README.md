# Calculator

## Description

#### This is a calculator that I have built from scratch using my knowledge of Javascript, jQuery, and basic Bootstrap. 
#### As this was one of my first projects at LearningFuze it is all completed in the index.html file.
#### It can also handle order of operations.
###### example: "3+5*6=33"
